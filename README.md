# ASP.Net Core WordpressAPI
## A C# Wordpress REST API wrapper built using .Net Core

The objective of this project is to bring the best of 2 worlds together, utilizing the Wordpress platform for common backend functionality while building the front end using the tools of choice, providing an ASP.Net Core WebAPI for backend communications. I use Wordpress regularly as a go-to for throwing content-centric sites up quickly, but with customization, I consistently run into road blocks, particularly when it comes to layout and themes. The ability to manage content using wp-admin and blog authoring tools works great, but getting the site to look, feel and behave becomes a challenge, leaving me feeling like I can get 80% of the way at best. The Wordpress REST API provides the mechanism to get me across the finish line. 

This project will start with the core library containing the functionality for interacting with the WP REST API, and an ASP.Net Core WebAPI project that can be used as a starting point for any application, or just simply implement the core WordpressAPI library in any flavor of your existing ASP.Net web application.

## Objectives

The first objectives are centered on reading/pulling content from the WP backend and displaying it on a custom web front end. 

The first priorities look kind of like this:

- Pull Wordpress Page content
- Pull Wordpress Blog post content

## Next Steps

Ultimately, the intention of this project will provide binding to all of the functionality of the WP REST API. Depending on interest, time and resources, these features will be prioritized and planned for a future release.
